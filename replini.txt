                         === DISCLAIMER ===


I allow you to use and distribute REPLINI freely under the condition
that I am in no way responsible for any damage or loss you may suffer.

I CANNOT guarantee that REPLINI will work for you. However I'v done
my best to test the program and I can only say that It works for me.

WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING
________________________________________________________________________

REPLINI will RESTART the Workplace shell. Make sure all applications are
closed before using REPLINI.
________________________________________________________________________


NOTES on REPLINI version 0.9:


REPLINI (ReplaceIni) will replace the OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI with a copy
(made by 'COPYINI'?) of these files from another location.
The reason for this program is that it is rather cumbersome to replace the
current active ini-files when the workplace shell has these two files in
use.


REPLINI will replace both ini's by restarting the workplace shell two times:

The first time the workplace shell will be restarted to use the new version
of the ini's at the specified location.

Then REPLINI will rename the original ini files to save versions. Their
names will be OS2.nnn and OS2SYS.nnn where 'nnn' will be the first number
that produces non-existing file names.

Then REPLINI will copy the new ini's from the specified directory to the
directory where the original ini's were located.

Finally, REPLINI will restart the workplace shell to use the copied
ini files.

The whole process should take no more than a few seconds.


When one of the steps described above fails, REPLINI will try to restore
all changes!


FIRST TIME USAGE:

Make sure you have a saved copy of your ini files. Should REPLINI fail
press RESET (C-A-D), boot from a boot disk and restore your saved copy of
the ini files.


KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

-  Objects from 'startup' folders will not restart when using REPLINI.

-  Occasionally, a protection violation was seen in the WPCLSLST.DLL from
   the OS/2 TOOLKIT.
   When 'Close the application' was chosen in the protection violation
   prompt, the workplace shell restarted normally.

-  After REPLINI has been used on the March '93 BETA of OS/2 2.1
   (Release level 6.489) Shutdown no longer works. Use Ctrl-Alt-Del
   to reboot.
