                   === NOTES on ASSOEDIT ===

Assoedit.exe allows you to inspect or modify associations set for
file- and typefilters.
You can add new associations, remove old ones and change defaults
associations.
Also, you can add new filetypes.


Simply copy ASSOEDIT.EXE and ASSOEDIT.HLP to your harddisk.

If you do not start ASSOEDIT.EXE from the same directory as the .hlp file
is located make sure you have placed the .HLP file in a directory that is
included in your helppath in the config.sys (SET HELP=...).
