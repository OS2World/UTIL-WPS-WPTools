                      === DISCLAIMER ===


I allow you to use and distribute HWAIT freely under the condition that 
I am in no way responsible for any damage or loss you may suffer.

Notes on HWAIT
===============

HWAIT is a program that makes it possible to synchronize events in different
sessions. You can do this by starting HWAIT with a parameter that tells 
HWAIT to wait for a named signal from another session.
In the other session you can start HWAIT with another parameter to send a
named signal.

Without parameters HWAIT assumes you have used HSTART in a DOS session with
the /WAIT parameter, and the program sends the default signal to HSTART.

HWAIT will only work on OS/2 2.1. (Both OS/2 and DOS sessions)


USING HWAIT
============

Before HWAIT can be used make sure you have placed the file 'SEMFUNCS.DLL'
in a directory that is included in your 'LIBPATH' statement from your
config.sys.



        HWAIT [options]

        Valid options are:

        HWAIT /W:xxxxx          Wait for a signal with xxxxx as name.

        HWAIT /S:xxxxx          Send named signal with xxxxx as name.

        HWAIT /?                Show the help screen

        The last two options are mutually exclusive.

        Without any parameters HWAIT assumes you have used HSTART in a 
        DOS session with the /WAIT parameter and sends the default signal.

   
A signal can only be send if in another session HSTART or HWAIT are waiting
for it, otherwise HWAIT will give an error message.


HISTORY
=======

Version 0.9: Initial release


EXAMPLE 1:  using hstart with /WAIT from a dos session
==========

        HSTART "Binkley term" /fs /wait e:\binkley\bink1.cmd

        contents of 'bink2.cmd':
        ------------------
        E:
        CD \BINKLEY
        BTP
        E:\OS2TOOLS\HWAIT <- default: signals to hstart to continue
        -----------------

EXAMPLE 2:  using hstart & hwait as seperate programs
==========

        contents of 'bink.bat'
        -------------------------
        HSTART "Binkley term" /FS e:\binkley\bink2.cmd
        HWAIT /W:BINK2             <- wait for signal BINK2
        -------------------------

        contents of 'bink2.cmd
        -------------------------
        E:
        CD \BINKLEY
        BTP
        E:\OS2TOOLS\HWAIT /S:BINK2 <- send signal 'BINK2'
        -------------------------

Note: In the two examples above a DOS and a OS/2 session is being used.
      This could also be signaling between DOS/DOS or OS/2/OS2 sessions.

      Also, in the 2nd example HSTART is being used, this could of 
      course also be another program like OS/2's START or STARTD.
