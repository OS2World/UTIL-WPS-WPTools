=== NOTES on COPYINI ===

COPYINI will make a copy of you OS2.INI an OS2SYS.INI to a specified 
directory. Both these ini-files contain a lot of empty space as a
result of the updating of records. COPYINI will result in much smaller
ini-files.

NOTE: COPYINI will only work if presentation manager has been started!

Syntax:

        COPYINI DIRECTORY [/NWT]

        DIRECTORY - A directory where the copied ini-files will be located.

        /NWT      - Optional, if specified COPYINI will use an undocumented
                    API-Call reset the Write Through bit temporary. This
                    will result in a faster copy operation.


You could decide to let the ini files be copied to your \OS2\INSTALL 
directory. 
In that case whenever you keep ALT-F1 pressed when booting your PC these new
ini's will be copied to your \OS2 directory. 
(NOTE: also the CONFIG.SYS and STARTUP.CMD will be copied from the
install directory to the root directory then!)
You should take care when using this method. The version of OS2.INI and
OS2SYS.INI that are creating during the installation of OS/2 contain
instructions to CREATE the desktop. The copied version of the ini-files 
contain less than that. You must be sure the desktop's directory structure 
is intact when new ini's are copied back.


An alternate way to allow you to copy the new ini's is to boot from a
BOOTABLE diskette and copy them manually.

Yet another way is to change the PROTSHELL line in the config.sys. If you
change it to PROTSHELL=X:\OS2\CMD.EXE (where X stands for you OS/2 drive)
when booting OS/2 you will not start the workplace shell but a CMD session.
From this session you can manually copy the ini's, and then start the
workplace shell by typing PMSHELL at the command line.

NOTE: When you use the method mentioned above a lot of programs (copyini
itself, but also checkini, will NOT work !)



=== HOW COPYINI WORKS ===


COPYINI uses only fully documented calls. It queries via PrfQueryProfileData
all application names within the ini-files. Than, per application name all
the key names are queried, and the per app/key pair the data is retrieved
and written out the the new ini-files.


Changes in COPYINI november 1992:

o   Updated the documentation files (this file)

Changes to version 1.1:

o   COPYINI does not work when PM has not been started. I fiddled a bit
    with some tests to see if PM was active, until now with little success.

Changes to version 1.2:

o   Optional, COPYINI now can use an UNDOCUMENTED call to allow caching to 
    INI-Files. This will result in a better performance.

o   COPYINI will no longer display all application-key pairs. It will only
    show application names and the count of keys.
