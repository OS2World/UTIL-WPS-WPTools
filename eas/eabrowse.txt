NOTES ON THIS PROGRAM
====================================

This program - The EA-Browser - is a program under development. 
It is not yet finished. 

It will however function as the title says:
It allows you to browse thru the extended attributes on your disks.
Also you can change and delete existing extended attributes now. 

But beware: editing in the so-called 'binary mode' acts a bit strange:

The <INSERT> key inserts a single byte (value 00h) at the current cursor
location.
The <DELETE> key removes the single byte at the cursor location.

When you have changed an EA you must choose 'Attributes->Save' in order 
to save the changes. 


WHAT THE PROGRAM SHOWS
======================

The top-left-side list box will show all files and directories in the
current directory. 
The top-right-side list box will show all extended attributes belonging 
the the file or directory that is selected in the top-left-side listbox.

The bottom half of the screen will show the extended attribute itself.

It will show the EA depening on a menu-option:

-  When 'Binary Mode' is selected no EA-type formatting will take place and
   the EA will be shown in hexadecimal (left) and character (right)
   presentation.

-  When 'Binary Mode' is not selected the program will try to show the EA
   based on the EA-type. The EA-type is normally specified by the first two
   bytes of the EA. Several EA's do however not follow this convention or
   they do not match the way the format of an EA-type as described in the 
   'IBM Redbooks'.
   Unknown EA-types are always displayed in binary mode. 

   Some EA-types are unclear to me: ASN.1 and MVST. I've never seen them
   being used and do not know the format (yet). They will always be shown
   in binary mode.    
   Also EA's containing Metafiles and bitmaps are shown in binary mode.
   See KNOWN BUGS for more information.

-  When showing an icon the icon is presented on a button. Pressing this
   button will lauch ICONEDIT.EXE (if it is in your PATH!).

You can change directories by double-clicking on a directory or by 
selecting 'Change Directory' from the menu.

KNOWN BUGS
==========

The program tries to show the EA's according the the EA type. EA type
information is however stored in the EA itself (the first 2 bytes) but can
be incorrect or even not used (the data starts at the beginning).
Rexx command files don't follow conventions there.

The EA-Browser can (in theory) try to show an EA based on a specified EA
type and run into a protection violation if the EA has violated the format 
of the specified type.
Should this be the case try looking at the EA after you have selected 
'Binary mode' from the menu.



THE FUTURE OF THIS PROGRAM
==========================

The options in the menu are mostly 'Not yet implemented' and I am not even
sure if they will ever be..

I am releasing this program as a BETA and so that anyone who thinks this
program might be interesting can drop me a note with hints-tip-wishes.

An important question is: 
  Should this program have the ability to change extended attributes? 
  With the risk of changing some vital piece of information so that your
  workplace shell never works again?

If you have any ideas, please send them to me at the above Fidonet address.

Notes on version 0.30:

o       An error was corrected so that EABROWSE will function under WARP.
        The error occured when showing .ICON or .ICON1 eas. EABROWSE would
        trap.

Notes on version 0.31:
o       Made a small change so EABROWSE will show if an extended attribute
        is critical or not.
